### Overview 
In this project we examined and exprinenced various automonous driving systems on various platforms. <br />
At first, we worked with Microsoft's AirSim, An realistic open world driving simulator. <br />
The AirSim simulator can Simulate various sensors, cameras and scenarios. <br />
We implemented our own "Auto-Pilot" system - Lane Assist and Auto Emergancy Brake based on data we recieved from sensors such as Lidar. <br />

<br />
After understanding the concepts of the autononous driving on a simulator, we moved on to the real world <br />
Our next step was implementing those systems on an mobile android platform, we sucsessfully managed to detect lane and objects. <br />

<br />
We continued our journey in the embedded world, we tried to implement those system on a RP4 platform , than test it on a RC car and a track, 
unfortunetly the RP4 was lacking the hardware to drive the car in realtime. <br />

<br />
Since better performace was needed, we switched the Nvidia's Jetson Nano, a powerfull embedded system. <br />

### Conclustions
The question that we had in mind doing this project is if it is possible to develop an cross-platform application that would be able the drive cars
autonomously, a piece of sftware that can be installed on a microprocessor such as raspberrt pi, mobile android device and a desktop PC.<br />
the answer is - it depends.
<br />
While there are some light softwares that enables basic autonomous cababilities, it is not reliable and cannot be used in the real world.
