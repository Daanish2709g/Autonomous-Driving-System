## Android
This chapter is all about mobile android devices. <br />
We implemented Lane and Object detection on an android device using openCV and keras model. <br />
This was one of our biggest challenges, since we used a relatively weak device - Xiaomi redmi 6, perforamce was an issue.
We didnt get the results we were hoping for.
